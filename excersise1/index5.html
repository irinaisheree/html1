    <h1>Separation of concerns</h1>
    <a>In  <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a></cite>,<strong>separation of concerns</strong> is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections. Each section addresses a separate concern, a set of information that affects the code of a computer program. A concern can be as general as "the details of the hardware for an application", or as specific as "the name of which class to instantiate". </a>

    <a>A program that embodies <em>SoC</em> well is called a modular[1] program. <em>Modularity</em>, and hence separation of concerns, is achieved by encapsulating information inside a section of code that has a well-defined interface. Encapsulation is a means of information hiding.</a>
    <a> Layered designs in information systems are another embodiment of separation of concerns (e.g., presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, persistence layer).</a>

      </p> 
      <abbr>Separation of concerns</abbr> results in more degrees of freedom for some aspect of the program's design, deployment, or usage. </a>
